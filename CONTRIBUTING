Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the project.
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`.
3. Create your changes.
4. Make sure the tests pass on your machine if you have added or updated any:
  - `pipenv run test`
  - If you don't have `pipenv` installed, you can install it with `pip install pipenv`.
  - Tests will try to access the secret scanning API with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`.
6. Open a pull request.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write expected tests for your changes.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
